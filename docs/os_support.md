# OS Support

It is recommended to run the server component of this bot on linux and running it in other environments is untested.
`kssh` is tested and works correctly on Linux, macOS, and Windows. If running on Windows, note that there is a dependency
on the `ssh` binary being in the path. This can be installed in a number of different ways including 
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/openssh) or the 
[built in version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) on 
modern versions of windows.
